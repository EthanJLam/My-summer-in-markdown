# My Summer in Markdown
## Ethan Lam

### A Little Bit About Me

My name is Ethan and I am in 10th grade. My main hobbies are playing videos games and basketball. I also like to watch movies and TV a lot as well.

### Favorite Movies and TV Shows to Watch

My favorite franchises are Star Wars and Marvel. My favorite movie of all time is either, "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back" or "Avengers: Endgame". Both these movies are iconic with great story, characters, and scenes. This summer I've been watching a lot of X-Men movies and also have been watching a lot of "How I Met Your Mother."

### Summer Travel Experience

This summer I traveled to Cabo, Mexico on a Cruise with my family. I spent about week on the trip and was the first time I've ever been on a cruise or to Mexico. There were many things to do on the cruise as well as many cool places to see when we arrived to Mexico. I didn't spend a lot of time in Mexico, but I saw a lot of the culture and places there.

### Basketball and Working Out

This summer I played a lot of basketball and worked out as well. I either played basketball or worked out about 3 or 4 times a week. I've made lot of progress in my skills this summer as well as gotten much stronger. My dad helped me as well almost all the time.

### Goals for the Year

This year of highschool will probably be harder than the last, but I hope I can still succeed in school and in other things in life. I hope that I can get all A's this year even though I'm taking 4 AP classes. I also want to make the basketball team again since I've gotten cut this summer but I've improved a lot since then. I just hope I can show my coaches and teammates how much I've improved. Then finally I just hope to have a good year overall.
